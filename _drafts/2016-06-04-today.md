# Namespaces are all over Python

Python is riddled with strict namespace rules. This is infact the last point in the Zen

    Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

In the last post, I talked about MergeSort. It can also be used if want to find out the number of inversions. An inversion is defined as the number of times we have to switch the numbers to get them in sorted order.
So for

    1, 3, 2

the answer would be 1.

We have to pass information in the recursion here. But, functions have their own namespaces. So, you can't define a variable globally and call it everywhere. 

{% highlight python %}
def print_global_variable():
    global_variable += 1
    print global_variable

global_variable = 1
print_global_variable()
1
{% endhighlight %}


This works, sure. But when we try to change the global variable, we get the 

    UnboundLocalError: local variable 'global_variable' referenced before assignment

I believe the reason is that the function has read only access to the global namespace. It can define the variable in it's own space and do whatever it wants to to it, it won't affect the global variable.

{% highlight python %}
def print_global_variable():
    global_variable = 5
    global_variable += 1
    print global_variable

global_variable = 1
print_global_variable()
6
print global_variable
1
{% endhighlight %}

Fairenough.

This presents a problem for the transfer for the information along the recursion. This won't work for example:

{% highlight python %}
def print_a(c):
    try:
        print a
    except:
        print "a defined at c=%i"%c
        a = "a defined at c=%i"%c
    if c>=1:
        return 0
    c+=1
    return print_a(c)

print_a(0)
a defined at c=0
a defined at c=1
{% endhighlight %}

`a` is not saved, it is defined newly for each function on the stack. In this case, this is how we can pass our inversion count to the next function:

{% highlight python %}
def sort(userinput):
    if len(userinput)<=1:
        return userinput

    middle = int(len(userinput)/2)
    left = sort(userinput[:middle])[0]
    right = sort(userinput[middle:])[0]
    return merge(inv, left, right)


def merge(inv, left, right):
    l, r = 0,0
    output = []

    while l<len(left) and r<len(right):
        if left[l] < right[r]:
            output.append(left[l])
            l+=1
        else:
            output.append(right[r])
            r+=1
            inv+=len(left[l:])

    output.append(left[l:])
    output.append(right[r:])
    return (output, inv)

print sort([11, 6, 2, 8, 4, 1, 18])
[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 11, 18]

{% endhighlight %}
