# Twisted implements the reactor pattern with whistles in pure Python

Use Twisted when you want to handle tasks asynchronously with a single thread. This library powers Scrapy and this is how I got around to read about it.

For tasks that are blocking, Twisted returns `deferred`s which represent an result in processing. They can be fired only once and can have a chain of callbacks/errbacks attached to them that are fired on success/failures.

{% highlight python %}
from twisted.internet.defer import Deferred

def callback_function(res):
    print res
    print "success"

def errback_function(err):
    print err
    print "failure"

d = Deferred()
d.addCallbacks(callback_function, errback_function)
d.callback("fire the first callback")
print "finished"

{% endhighlight %}
This prints as expected:

{% highlight python %}
fire the first callback
success
finished
{% endhighlight %}

We can fire the `errback` as well. Like so:

{% highlight python %}

d2 = Deferred()
d2.addCallbacks(callback_function, errback_function)
d2.errback(Exception("fire the first errback"))
print "finished"

{% endhighlight %}

Note we had to pass the exception to fire the `errback`. We need Failure (`twisted.python.failure.Failure`) object to be precise but Twisted wraps the Exception to Failure

This prints:

{% highlight python %}
[Failure instance: Traceback (failure with no frames): <type 'exceptions.Exception'>: fire the first errback]
failure
finished
{% endhighlight %}
