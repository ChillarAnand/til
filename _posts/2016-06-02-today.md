Don't understimate the power of static sites. You can achieve a lot with JavaScript. The UI can be made awesome and you can also have pop ups and stuff. 

You can collect detailed statistics about where the user clicks, how long he views the page, where is he from.

There is also the option to embed comments using Disqus etc. There are front-end professionals working full time on the static sites, it takes a lot of work to beautify.
