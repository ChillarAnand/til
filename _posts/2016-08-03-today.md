Let's say you have a `hello.sh` script that you want to run.

{% highlight bash %}
#! /bin/bash
echo "Hello World!"
{% endhighlight %}

You cannot run this script as is without calling `bash` (or `sh`)
{% highlight bash %}
$ ./hello.sh
bash: ./hello.sh: Permission denied

$ sudo ./hello.sh
bash: ./hello.sh: command not found
{% endhighlight %}

To run this, you need to `chmod` it and make it executable. Like so:

{% highlight bash %}
$ chmod +x hello.sh
$ ./hello.sh
Hello World!
{% endhighlight %}
