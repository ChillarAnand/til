title: use zope.interface to define interfaces

# zope.interface is a nifty tool

Interface are when you want your classes to behave in a certain way by the virtue of them necessarily having some methods and attributes. They are great when you want to enforce a blueprint of structure you want certain classes to follow. 

Some terminology first:


> A class **implements** the interface

> The instances of that class (the objects) **provide** the interface

zope.interface is a library that let's you easily create and use interfaces in Python.

Taking the example from their documentation:


{% highlight python %}
>>> import zope.interface
>>> class IFoo(zope.interface.Interface):
...    """Foo blah blah"""
...
...    x = zope.interface.Attribute("""X blah blah""")
...
...    def bar(q, r=None):
...        """bar blah blah"""
{% endhighlight %}

Here, we defined the IFoo interface that says that any class *implementing* this interface has to have 2 attributes - `x` and `bar`. 

Now, a class that implements this interface:

{% highlight python %}
>>> class Foo:
...     zope.interface.implements(IFoo)
...
...     def __init__(self, x=None):
...         self.x = x  # this was mandated by the interface
...
...     def bar(self, q, r=None):
...         return q, r, self.x  # this was mandated by the interface too
...
...     def __repr__(self):
...         return "Foo(%s)" % self.x # we can have extra methods 

>>> foo = Foo(12)
{% endhighlight %}

Here, `IFoo` is the interface, `Foo` _implements_ that interface, `foo` _provides_ that interface
