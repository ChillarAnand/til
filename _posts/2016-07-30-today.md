# What's the deal with syntax highlighters?

The code on this micro blog till now is ugly. It has been rendered very badly and that needs to improve. I spent some time looking at the various syntax highlighters and how they work. I know of Pygyments(written in Python) and Rogue (written in Ruby).

At a very high level, the library consumes the code and identifies different parts of it, in very high detail. Comments, errors, keywords etc are identified. Among comments too, multiline, preproc, single line comments all are identified.

This identification is then styled using certain themes. So, the library takes in the theme name and generates the css file which you can embed in your code. The css file has formatting for each identified part of the code. 

You can change the css to create new themes and share them with the world. Pretty cool.
