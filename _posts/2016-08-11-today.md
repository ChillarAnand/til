# Both defer in a very subtle way

I never liked licenses. They are difficult to read and reek of slyness. Their very presence at some place is to prevent folks from out maneuvering each other.

In all this babel, the MIT license stands out. It is extremely simple to read and understand, giving everyone the right to do anything they want to with the code. 

The BSD is that too, with one very important difference. You cannot use the code commercially. Sans that, do whatever you wish.

I am sure this is only one side of the story, there must be many more subtleties involved, as they generally are in legal matters.
